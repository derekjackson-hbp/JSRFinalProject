        		<p class="recommend nodys">This web page demonstrates accessible elements for web pages. For example, on this page the "Pages Menu" is enitrely navigable with the keyboard, as are all of the pages in this demonstration.</p>
             <p class="recommend nodys">You can see on this page there are two buttons in the banner, a "Readability" button and an "OpenDyslexic" button. The "Readability" button toggles the display of the "main" section. When selected, settings are chosen to improve readability for people with dyslexia and other cognitive disabilities. Deselect this button to compare it to regualr browser settings. You might also find readbility for all users improves with the optimized settings.</p>
              <p class="recommend nodys">The "OpenDyslexic" button displays the OpenDyslexic font when it is selected. This is a font designed for dyslexic users and may give some idea of the difficulties these users have when encountering pages that have not been designed with accessibility in mind.</p> 
            <p class="recommend nodys">The "Sample Menu" will load samples of accessible web content into this "main" region of the web page. Note that when the page content is updated, the title of the page also changes to reflect the change of context. Also you will notice the "skip link appears" with the blue border indicating that focus has moved to the beginning of the page.<p>
